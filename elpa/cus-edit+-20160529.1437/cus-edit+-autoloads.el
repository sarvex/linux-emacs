Open Customize to check all preferences currently set but not saved.
This is useful in `kill-emacs-query-functions' to check changes you
have made (and possibly saving them) before exiting Emacs.

Changes to preferences listed in `customize-customized-ignore'
are normally ignored here.  However, with non-`nil' CHECK-ALL-P (prefix
argument), all changes are checked.

Changes to preferences that you have declared \"unchanged\" (using,
for example, `Consider Unchanged') are always ignored here.

seconds it will check for user preferences that have been changed
outside of Customize.  All user preference (variable and face) changes
